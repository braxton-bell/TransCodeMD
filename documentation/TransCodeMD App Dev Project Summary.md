# TransCodeMD App Dev Project Summary

**Project Description: Enhancing Markdown Documentation with Source Code Transclusion Using VB.NET**

**Objective:** 
Develop a VB.NET application to seamlessly integrate and synchronize source code with Markdown documentation, enabling direct transclusion of code into Markdown files. This solution addresses the limitation in native Markdown specifications, which do not allow direct transclusion of code blocks from script documents.

**Key Features and Process:**

1. **Source Code Transclusion:** 
   - The application allows for the inclusion of various source code files (.py, .cs, .vb, .ps1, etc.) in Markdown documents, overcoming the limitations of native Markdown through a workaround.
   - It maintains a dual-file system: the original source code file and its corresponding Markdown representation. 
   - The Markdown file serves as the transcludable document in other Markdown files, ensuring a single source of truth.

2. **Example Implementation:**
   - **Original Source Code (`myScript.vb`):**
     ```vb
     -------------------------------------------
	 |Public Class TestClass                   |
     |  Public Sub New()                       |
     |    Write.Console("Hello, world!")       |
     |  End Sub                                |
     |End Class                                |
     -------------------------------------------
     ```
   - **Markdown Representation (`myScript.vb.md`):**
     ```markdown
    ---------------------------------------------
	| ``vb                                       |
    | Public Class TestClass                     |
    |   Public Sub New()                         |
    |     Write.Console("Hello, world!")         |
    |   End Sub                                  |
    | End Class                                  |
    | ``                                         |
    ---------------------------------------------- 
     ```

   - The Markdown file (`myScript.vb.md`) is what will be transcluded into other Markdown documents.

3. **File Monitoring and Synchronization:**
   - Utilizes a file monitoring system similar to `FileSystemWatcher`.
   - Monitors specified directories for changes in either the source code or its Markdown representation.
   - Bi-directional sync: updates in the source code reflect in the Markdown file and vice versa.

4. **Handling Concurrent Modifications and Conflict Resolution:**
   - The `.transclude` file in each directory lists the files to be synced, guiding the synchronization process.
   - Source code changes take precedence in concurrent modification scenarios.
   - Implements conflict logs or 'merge needed' files for manual resolution of conflicts.

5. **Safety Measures and Technical Specifications:**
   - Designed for use with Git repositories, leveraging Git's inherent backup and version control features.
   - Initial version focuses on simplicity with console-based error logging, considering future integration with advanced logging tools like Serilog.
   - Compatible with .NET 6 or 7.

6. **User Interface and Operation:**
   - Pure console application, logging significant events for monitoring.
   - Ideal for continuous operation in a development environment.

7. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Focused on ensuring functional integrity for personal development projects.
   - Emphasizes real-world application in the developer's workflow.

**Overall Concept:**
This project aims to bridge a crucial gap in Markdown documentation by enabling the integration of live source code. By maintaining a synchronized relationship between source files and their Markdown representations, developers can effortlessly transclude source code into documentation, enhancing accuracy and reducing redundancy in the documentation process.
